# OmegaGamesVasa 
Fullstack e-Commerce website for a school project.

I was a part of the team Vasa where I acted as the .NET Cloud Developer. I was in charge with a classmate with setting up the cloud on Azure, CI/CD pipelines and handling the budget given to us by the school. During the downtime in my role I worked on frontend.
